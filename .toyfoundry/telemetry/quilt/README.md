# Toyfoundry Telemetry Quilt

The telemetry quilt captures rollups generated by the Toyfoundry loom. Files in this
folder are derived artefacts and may be regenerated at any time.

## Key Files

- `schema.json` — Placeholder schema describing the mint-only quilt rollup structure.
- `composite_schema.json` — Schema fragment outlining the composite rollup that merges mint and ritual telemetry.
- `quilt_rollup.json` — Latest loom output summarising Alfa mint telemetry.
- `quilt_rollup_all.json` — Composite rollup combining mint, Drill, Parade, Purge, and Promote telemetry.

## Rollup Fields

Each `quilt_rollup.json` document is a JSON object keyed by `alfa_id`. Every entry
contains:

- `name` — Human-facing Alfa name recorded during mint.
- `dry_runs` — Count of dry-run mints observed for this Alfa.
- `mint_runs` — Count of non-dry-run mints recorded.
- `latest_status` — Most recent status value emitted by the mint telemetry ("draft" or "minted").
- `first_seen` / `last_seen` — ISO 8601 timestamps bracketing observed telemetry events.
- `last_output_path` — Path to the most recent manifest output when available.

The composite rollup (`quilt_rollup_all.json`) is keyed by an operation identifier —
for mint events this is the `alfa_id`, and for ritual telemetry it defaults to the
reported `batch_id`. Each entry includes:

- `mint` — Optional mint rollup matching the structure above when mint telemetry is available.
- `rituals` — Nested objects per ritual (`drill`, `parade`, `purge`, `promote`) containing `events` (ordered chronologically) and aggregate counters (`total`, `dry_runs`, `completed`).
- `last_updated` — ISO 8601 timestamp of the most recent event observed for that operation.

Additional fields may be appended as the loom evolves. Downstream automation should
handle additive expansion gracefully.
