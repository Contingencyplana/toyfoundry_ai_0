# Toyfoundry Telemetry Quilt

The telemetry quilt captures rollups generated by the Toyfoundry loom. Files in this
folder are derived artefacts and may be regenerated at any time.

## Key Files

- `schema.json` — Placeholder schema describing the quilt rollup structure.
- `quilt_rollup.json` — Latest loom output summarising Alfa mint telemetry.

## Rollup Fields

Each `quilt_rollup.json` document is a JSON object keyed by `alfa_id`. Every entry
contains:

- `name` — Human-facing Alfa name recorded during mint.
- `dry_runs` — Count of dry-run mints observed for this Alfa.
- `mint_runs` — Count of non-dry-run mints recorded.
- `latest_status` — Most recent status value emitted by the mint telemetry ("draft" or "minted").
- `first_seen` / `last_seen` — ISO 8601 timestamps bracketing observed telemetry events.
- `last_output_path` — Path to the most recent manifest output when available.

Additional fields may be appended as new rituals feed the loom. Downstream automation
should handle additive expansion gracefully.
