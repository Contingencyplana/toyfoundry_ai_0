# Telemetry Quilt Exports

Exports in this directory are regenerated by the telemetry quilt loom when invoked with the
`--export` flag:

```powershell
python -m tools.telemetry.quilt_loom --export
```

Generated artefacts:

- `composite_export.json` — JSON array of flattened ritual events and mint metadata.
- `composite_export.csv` — CSV version of the same dataset for tabular consumers.

See `planning/toyfoundry/telemetry/export_schema.md` for a full description of the schema
and ingestion guidance.
