# Resource Management Reception Interface

## Overview

This specification defines how resource management systems receive AI-driven optimization insights while maintaining operational control over resource allocation.

## Reception Architecture

### Input Channel

```json
{
    "enhancement": {
        "type": "resource_optimization",
        "target": "resource_system",
        "parameters": {
            "allocation_strategy": {},
            "utilization_targets": [],
            "scheduling_rules": []
        }
    }
}
```


### Response Channel

```json
{
    "status": {
        "type": "optimization_applied",
        "metrics": {
            "utilization_rate": 0,
            "efficiency_gain": 0,
            "resource_savings": 0
        },
        "validation": {
            "schema": true,
            "safety": true,
            "capacity": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Passive Reception**
   - Resource systems maintain control
   - AI insights received as suggestions
   - Local allocation authority preserved
   - Independent verification required

2. **Enhancement Types**
   - Resource allocation strategies
   - Utilization optimization
   - Scheduling improvements
   - Capacity planning insights

3. **Validation Gates**
   - Schema compliance (Order-036)
   - Resource constraint validation
   - Capacity limit verification
   - Efficiency baseline checks

4. **Telemetry Feedback**
   - Utilization metrics
   - Efficiency measurements
   - Resource availability stats
   - Allocation success rates

## Integration Points

### 1. Allocation Strategy Receiver

- Endpoint: `/resources/allocation`
- Purpose: Receives optimized allocation patterns
- Integration: Production demand feedback

### 2. Utilization Optimizer Receiver

- Endpoint: `/resources/utilization`
- Purpose: Receives utilization improvements
- Integration: Real-time usage monitoring

### 3. Scheduling Enhancement Receiver

- Endpoint: `/resources/scheduling`
- Purpose: Receives scheduling optimizations
- Integration: Workflow coordination

### 4. Capacity Planning Receiver

- Endpoint: `/resources/capacity`
- Purpose: Receives capacity insights
- Integration: Demand forecasting

## Security Measures

1. Read-only reception interfaces
2. Resource constraint enforcement
3. Capacity limit protection
4. Allocation audit trails
5. Emergency override capability
