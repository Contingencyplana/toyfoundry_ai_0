# R&D Telemetry Reporting Protocol

## Overview

This specification defines how manufacturing systems report telemetry data back to R&D for AI enhancement optimization.

## Telemetry Architecture

### Core Reporting Interface

```json
{
    "telemetry": {
        "type": "manufacturing_feedback",
        "source_domain": "production",
        "target": "r_and_d",
        "reporting_mode": "structured",
        "payload": {
            "metrics": {},
            "events": [],
            "performance_data": {},
            "enhancement_feedback": []
        }
    }
}
```

### Feedback Channels

1. Process Performance Metrics
   - Enhancement effectiveness
   - Resource utilization
   - Quality improvements
   - Production efficiency

2. Integration Success Metrics
   - AI insight application rate
   - Enhancement adoption success
   - System coordination efficiency
   - Cross-domain optimization

3. Safety and Compliance Data
   - Validation gate performance
   - Security measure effectiveness
   - Constraint adherence rates
   - Rollback statistics

4. Enhancement Impact Analysis
   - Productivity improvements
   - Quality enhancements
   - Resource optimization
   - System coordination

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Data Collection**
   - Automated metric gathering
   - Real-time event logging
   - Performance monitoring
   - Enhancement tracking

2. **Data Processing**
   - Metric aggregation
   - Trend analysis
   - Pattern detection
   - Impact assessment

3. **Reporting Flows**
   - Structured data feeds
   - Event-driven updates
   - Periodic summaries
   - Alert notifications

4. **Security Measures**
   - Data encryption
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
   - Privacy preservation

## Integration Points

1. Golf Domain Integration
   ```json
   {
       "domain": "golf_telemetry",
       "reporting_endpoints": {
           "process": "/telemetry/process",
           "scaling": "/telemetry/scaling",
           "quality": "/telemetry/quality",
           "integration": "/telemetry/system"
       }
   }
   ```

2. R&D Reception Points
   ```json
   {
       "reception": {
           "metrics": "/r_and_d/metrics",
           "events": "/r_and_d/events",
           "analysis": "/r_and_d/analysis",
           "feedback": "/r_and_d/feedback"
       }
   }
   ```

## Security Controls

1. One-way data flow to R&D
2. No control channel exposure
3. Data anonymization where needed
4. Full audit trail maintenance
5. Access control enforcement
