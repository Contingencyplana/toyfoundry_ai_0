# Toyfoundry Restructure Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the complete integration of all three stages of the Toyfoundry restructure, ensuring proper coordination between components.

## Stage Integration Map

### Stage 1 ↔ Stage 2 Integration

1. Production Directory → Golf Domains
   - assembly_lines → golf_00-03
   - quality_control → golf_08-11
   - resource_management → golf_04-07
   - telemetry → golf_12-15

2. Interface Mapping
   ```json
   {
       "assembly_lines": {
           "reception": "/golf_00/reception",
           "workflow": "/golf_01/workflow",
           "processing": "/golf_02/processing",
           "integration": "/golf_03/integration"
       },
       "quality_control": {
           "core": "/golf_08/reception",
           "integration": "/golf_09/integration",
           "analytics": "/golf_10/analytics",
           "optimization": "/golf_11/optimization"
       }
   }
   ```

### Stage 2 ↔ Stage 3 Integration

1. Golf Domain Enhancement Routes
   ```json
   {
       "manufacturing": {
           "process": "/ai_integration/process",
           "scaling": "/ai_integration/scaling",
           "quality": "/ai_integration/quality",
           "integration": "/ai_integration/system"
       }
   }
   ```

2. Cross-Domain Communication
   - High Command exchange protocol enforcement
   - Standardized message formats
   - Validation gate coordination
   - Telemetry aggregation

### Stage 3 ↔ Stage 1 Feedback Loop

1. Telemetry Flow
   - Production systems → Golf domains → R&D
   - Enhanced manufacturing interfaces
   - Quality feedback channels
   - Performance metrics

2. Enhancement Distribution
   - R&D insights → Golf domains → Production
   - Validation gate enforcement
   - Security measure coordination
   - Local control preservation

## Security Integration

1. **Cross-Stage Validation**
   - Schema compliance verification
   - Security measure coordination
   - Access control integration
   - Audit trail consolidation

2. **Control Preservation**
   - Local authority maintenance
   - Enhancement reception protocols
   - Safety measure coordination
   - Emergency override integration

## Migration Guidelines

1. **Legacy System Migration**
   - Gradual transition path
   - Backward compatibility
   - Data preservation
   - Service continuity

2. **New Enhancement Reception**
   - Controlled capability adoption
   - Validation gate verification
   - Performance monitoring
   - Rollback procedures

## Operation Protocols

1. **Normal Operations**
   - Standard enhancement flow
   - Regular telemetry reporting
   - Routine validation checks
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Exception Handling**
   - Enhancement rejection procedures
   - Validation failure response
   - Emergency shutdown protocol
   - Recovery procedures

## Verification Checklist
