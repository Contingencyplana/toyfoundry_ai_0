# Workflow Enhancement Reception

## Overview

This specification defines how manufacturing workflows receive AI-driven enhancements while maintaining proper separation of concerns.

## Reception Architecture

### Input Channel

```json
{
    "enhancement": {
        "type": "workflow_optimization",
        "target": "process_sequence",
        "parameters": {
            "timings": [],
            "dependencies": [],
            "constraints": []
        }
    }
}
```

### Response Channel

```json
{
    "status": {
        "type": "enhancement_applied",
        "metrics": {
            "throughput": 0,
            "efficiency": 0,
            "quality": 0
        },
        "validation": {
            "schema": true,
            "safety": true,
            "resources": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Passive Reception**
   - Workflows remain under local control
   - AI insights received as suggestions
   - All changes validated before application

2. **Enhancement Types**
   - Process sequence optimization
   - Timing adjustments
   - Resource allocation improvements
   - Quality parameter tuning

3. **Validation Gates**
   - Schema compliance (Order-036)
   - Safety bounds checking
   - Resource constraint validation
   - Quality metric verification

4. **Telemetry Feedback**
   - Performance metrics
   - Application status
   - Validation results
   - Resource impacts

## Integration Notes

1. All enhancements flow through High Command exchange
2. Local control systems retain final authority
3. Changes applied incrementally with validation
4. Full rollback capability maintained
