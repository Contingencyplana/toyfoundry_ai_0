# Pipeline Reception Protocol

## Overview

This specification defines how production pipelines receive AI-driven flow optimizations while maintaining process integrity.

## Reception Architecture

### Input Channel


```json
{
    "optimization": {
        "type": "pipeline_flow",
        "target": "material_movement",
        "parameters": {
            "rates": [],
            "buffers": [],
            "routing": {}
        }
    }
}
```

### Response Channel

```json
{
    "status": {
        "type": "flow_adjusted",
        "metrics": {
            "throughput": 0,
            "utilization": 0,
            "blockage_rate": 0
        },
        "validation": {
            "schema": true,
            "safety": true,
            "capacity": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Passive Reception**
   - Pipelines maintain flow control
   - AI insights received as flow adjustments
   - All changes validated against capacity

2. **Optimization Types**
   - Flow rate adjustments
   - Buffer management
   - Routing optimization
   - Blockage prevention

3. **Validation Gates**
   - Schema compliance (Order-036)
   - Capacity verification
   - Safety constraint checking
   - Flow balance validation

4. **Telemetry Feedback**
   - Flow rate metrics
   - Buffer levels
   - Blockage incidents
   - Utilization rates

## Integration Notes

1. All optimizations flow through High Command exchange
2. Local flow control systems retain authority
3. Changes applied with capacity validation
4. Emergency purge capability maintained
