## Key Principles

1. Passive Reception
   - All points are receive-only
   - No direct control capabilities
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. Validation First
   - Schema compliance checking
   - Safety bounds verification
   - Resource constraint validation

3. Telemetry Integration
   - Each point reports status
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Integration confirmation

4. Security Measures
   - Read-only interfaces
   - Validation gates
   - Audit logging
   - Rollback capability
