# Assembly Line Exchange Protocol

## Overview

This interface specification defines how assembly lines receive AI capabilities through the High Command exchange protocol.

## Schema Structure

```json
{
    "messageType": "assembly_enhancement",
    "version": "1.0",
    "schemaVersion": "Order-036",
    "direction": {
        "from": "ai_labscape",
        "to": "assembly_line"
    },
    "payload": {
        "enhancementType": "workflow|quality|resource|coordination",
        "targetSystem": "workflow|station|pipeline",
        "parameters": {},
        "constraints": {},
        "metrics": {}
    }
}
```

## Reception Points

1. **Workflow Enhancement**
   - Path: `/workflows/enhancement_receiver`
   - Purpose: Receives AI-optimized workflow patterns
   - Direction: One-way (labscape â†’ assembly)
   - Validation: Order-036 schema compliance

2. **Quality Optimization**
   - Path: `/stations/quality_receiver`
   - Purpose: Receives real-time quality parameters
   - Direction: Bidirectional (telemetry feedback)
   - Validation: Safety bounds checking

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Path: `/pipelines/resource_receiver`
   - Purpose: Receives resource optimization insights
   - Direction: Bidirectional (status updates)
   - Validation: Resource constraint checking

4. **Line Coordination**
   - Path: `/interfaces/coordination_receiver`
   - Purpose: Receives multi-line coordination data
   - Direction: Mesh (cross-line communication)
   - Validation: Synchronization verification

## Implementation Notes

1. All reception points are **passive receivers**
2. AI capabilities are received, never controlled
3. Each interface maintains its own telemetry output
4. All communication flows through High Command exchange

## Validation Requirements

1. Schema compliance (Order-036)
2. Safety bounds checking
3. Resource constraint validation
4. Synchronization verification
5. Telemetry confirmation

## Security Measures

1. Read-only reception points
2. Validation before application
3. Rollback capabilities
4. Audit logging
