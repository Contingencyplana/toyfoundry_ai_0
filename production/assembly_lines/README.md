# Assembly Lines

Manufacturing workflows designed to receive AI capabilities from the labscape network.

## Structure

- `workflows/` - Manufacturing process definitions
- `stations/` - Assembly station configurations
- `pipelines/` - Production pipeline specifications
- `interfaces/` - AI capability reception points

## AI Integration Points

Each assembly line is designed to receive capabilities from the labscape network through:

- Workflow enhancement receivers
- Quality optimization interfaces
- Resource allocation endpoints
- Cross-line coordination channels

## Exchange Protocol

- Incoming: AI-enhanced workflow optimizations
- Outgoing: Production telemetry and status
- Schema: Order-036 compliant
- Integration: High Command exchange protocol
