# Quality Control Reception Interface

## Overview


This specification defines how quality control systems receive AI-driven insights while maintaining independent verification capability.

## Reception Architecture

### Input Channel

```json
{
    "enhancement": {
        "type": "quality_insight",
        "target": "qa_system",
        "parameters": {
            "thresholds": [],
            "inspection_points": [],
            "validation_rules": []
        }
    }
}
```
```

### Response Channel

```json
{
    "status": {
        "type": "insight_applied",
        "metrics": {
            "detection_rate": 0,
            "false_positives": 0,
            "inspection_coverage": 0
        },
        "validation": {
            "schema": true,
            "safety": true,
            "standards": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Passive Reception**
   - QA systems maintain control
   - AI insights received as recommendations
   - Local validation gates enforced
   - Independent verification preserved

2. **Enhancement Types**
   - Quality threshold optimization
   - Inspection point placement
   - Defect pattern recognition
   - Test sequence optimization

3. **Validation Gates**
   - Schema compliance (Order-036)
   - Safety standard verification
   - Industry compliance checking
   - Performance baseline validation

4. **Telemetry Feedback**
   - Detection rate metrics
   - False positive analysis
   - Coverage statistics
   - Response time measurements

## Integration Points

### 1. Threshold Receiver

- Endpoint: `/quality/thresholds`
- Purpose: Receives optimized quality thresholds
- Integration: Real-time production feedback

### 2. Inspection Point Receiver

- Endpoint: `/quality/inspection_points`
- Purpose: Receives optimal inspection locations
- Integration: Assembly line coordination

### 3. Pattern Recognition Receiver

- Endpoint: `/quality/patterns`
- Purpose: Receives defect pattern insights
- Integration: Historical quality data

### 4. Test Sequence Receiver

- Endpoint: `/quality/test_sequences`
- Purpose: Receives optimized test flows
- Integration: Resource utilization feedback

## Security Measures

1. Read-only reception interfaces
2. Multi-stage validation pipeline
3. Standard compliance verification
4. Full audit trail maintenance
5. Rollback capability preservation
