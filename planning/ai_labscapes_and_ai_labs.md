# ?? ai_labscapes_and_ai_labs.md - AI Labscapes & Labs Guide  
*Frontline Handbook - `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*
---
## ?? Purpose
Defines the AI Labscape and its Labs so squads share a clear model of how hypotheses, prototypes, and field drills interlock across the lattice (Alfa -> Juliett). Complements battlefield and war-room guides without duplicating them.
---
## ?? Core Definitions
- AI Lab (Alfa): A 1x1 cell running a concrete hypothesis as a playable micro-experiment (code + config + telemetry).
- AI Labscape: A themed collection of Labs arranged on the lattice (e.g., Golf 16x16 = 256; Juliett 64x64 = 4,096).
- Battlefield (Field Alfa): A Lab oriented to action/emergence under live drills (see `planning/field_workspaces.md`).
- War-Room (HQ Alfa): A Lab oriented to deliberation/doctrine drafting (see `planning/high_command.md`).
- Mind/Dreamscapes: Concept terrains that inspire Lab design (see `planning/mindscapes_and_dreamscapes.md`).
---
## ?? Labscape Geometry
- Alfa: 1x1 - single Lab.
- Golf: 16x16 = 256 Labs - pilot scale for stable loops.
- Four Golfs: ~1,000 Labs - diversified pilots and comparative trials.
- Juliett: 64x64 = 4,096 Labs - full lattice for emergent behaviors.
- Mirrors doctrine: "Alfa 1x1 up to Juliett 64x64" and Phase 3 targets (4,096).

## ?? Lab Lifecycle (Hypothesis -> Archive)
1. Hypothesis: Question, risks, expected signals, exit criteria.
2. Prototype: Mint via Toyfoundry Forge rituals; record build info and manifests.
3. Drill/Trial: Run in field cadence; emit structured telemetry.
4. Roll-Up: Quilt telemetry into composite exports for review.
5. Deliberation: R&D war-tables evaluate efficacy, tone, and safety.
6. Decision: Promote, iterate, quarantine (Nightland), or archive with provenance.
Artifacts: `RFC.md`, `experiment.manifest.json`, `risk_notebook.json`, build info, and quilt rollups (see Toyfoundry telemetry exports).
---
## ?? Interfaces & Telemetry
- Manufacturing: Use Toyfoundry Forge to mint/upgrade Labs (see `planning/toyfoundry/` scrolls).
- Telemetry: Emit Alfa reports and composite quilt exports (e.g., `.toyfoundry/telemetry/quilt/exports/composite_export.csv`). Generate via `python -m tools.telemetry.quilt_loom --export`.
- Governance: Route decisions through R&D War-Tables and the rank structure.
---
## ?? Quickstart
- Mint a Lab: `python -m tools.forge.forge_mint_alfa`
- Stitch telemetry (rollups): `python -m tools.telemetry.quilt_loom`
- Export CSV/JSON: `python -m tools.telemetry.quilt_loom --export`
- Find exports at: `.toyfoundry/telemetry/quilt/exports/`
---
## ?? Roles
- Scientist: Frames hypotheses and evaluation criteria.
- Engineer: Implements prototypes and automation hooks.
- Safety Officer: Rates risk, watches tone/entropy; guards Nightland edges.
- Archivist: Maintains provenance, schemas, reproducibility.
- Squad (Toysoldiers): Exercises the experiment under live cadence.
---
## ?? Phased Growth Path
- Phase 1 - 256 Labs: Establish safe loops and reporting.
- Phase 2 - ~1,000 Labs: Diversify trials; compare families and doctrines.
- Phase 3 - 4,096 Labs: Full lattice; enable networked emergence with safeguards.
---
## ?? Field Maxim
> Keep the Labscape reproducible and the Labs speaking; emergence stays safe and legible across the lattice.
