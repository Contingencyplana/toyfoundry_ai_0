## Toyfoundry's Role: Front 5 (Manufacturing)

Toyfoundry operates as the **Manufacturing Front** within High Command's seven pivotal fronts:

**Mission:** Build and validate toy units via Forge/Parade/Purge/Promote rituals  
**Focus:** Production pipelines, telemetry, quality gates, artifact generation

**Canonical Spec:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/manufacturing.md` (High Command)  
**Local Docs:** `planning/toyfoundry/toyfoundry.md`

## The Seven Fronts (Quick Reference)

1. **Tons of Fun** — Game design, balance, player retention
2. **Safety** — AI safety, containment, kill-switches
3. **Documentation** — Clarity, templates, schemas
4. **R&D** — Research, experiments, SHAGI advancement
5. **Manufacturing (Toyfoundry)** — Production pipelines, telemetry ← **We are here**
6. **Field Ops (Toysoldiers)** — Deployment, monitoring
7. **Operations** — Exchange integrity, validation

**Full Canon:** See High Command `planning/pivotal_fronts/README.md`

## Cross-Front Coordination

Toyfoundry Manufacturing interfaces with:

- **Safety Front:** Validates builds don't violate safety gates before promotion
- **R&D Front:** Produces experimental builds for canary lanes
- **Field Ops Front:** Ships artifacts to Toysoldiers for deployment
- **Operations Front:** Uses exchange protocol for all order/ack/report flows

**Telemetry Aggregation:** Composite quilt exports feed dashboards for all fronts

## Strategic Alignment with Four Major Pivots

**Pivot One (70/30 Ratio):**  
Toyfoundry operations will become playable Alfa missions—human clicks grid cells instead of running PowerShell commands.

**Pivot Two (Playable Overlay):**  
Initial Alfa (`golf_00/delta_00/alfa_00/`) will visualize Forge ritual states as 16×16 emoji grid.

**Pivot Three (SHAGI Vision):**  
Manufacturing telemetry trains SHAGI on preference learning (what builds get promoted vs. purged).

**Pivot Four (Fractal Structure):**  
Toyfoundry Alfas scale across `golf_00` through `golf_15` (4,096 manufacturing missions).

## Current Priorities (Per High Command Orders)

- **Order 020:** Standard run with batch limits and checksums
- **Order 024:** Daylands safety pipeline pilot (sandbox → canary)
- **Order 028:** Canary batches with full artifact suite
- **Order 030:** Expand canary with distinct batch variants

**See:** Exchange ledger `exchange/ledger/journal.md` for full order history
